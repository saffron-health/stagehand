## Overview

This guide shows you how to use CrewAI with Browserbase to create intelligent agents that can automate web interactions. By the end of this guide, you'll know how to:

- Set up CrewAI with the StagehandTool
- Create agents that can interact with websites
- Automate browser tasks using natural language instructions
- Extract structured data from web pages

## When You'd Use This

The CrewAI integration is perfect for scenarios where you need intelligent web automation:

- **Research automation**: Have agents research information across multiple websites
- **Data collection**: Extract structured data from e-commerce sites, job boards, or news sites
- **Form automation**: Automatically fill out and submit forms based on specific criteria
- **Multi-step workflows**: Execute complex browser workflows that require decision-making

The StagehandTool wraps the Stagehand Python SDK to provide CrewAI agents with the ability to control a real web browser and interact with websites using three core primitives:

1. **Act**: Perform actions like clicking, typing, or navigating
2. **Extract**: Extract structured data from web pages
3. **Observe**: Identify and analyze elements on the page
