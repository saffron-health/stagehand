description: 'How Stagehand interacts with Playwright'
---

Stagehand is built on top of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), so you can use Playwright methods directly through the Stagehand instance.

## `page` and `context`

`stagehand.page` and `stagehand.context` are instances of Playwright's `Page` and `BrowserContext` respectively. Use these methods to interact with the Playwright instance that Stagehand is using.

<CodeGroup>
```TypeScript TypeScript
const page = stagehand.page;
// Base Playwright methods work
await page.goto("https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand");

// Stagehand overrides Playwright objects
await page.act("click on the contributors")
```

```python Python
page = stagehand.page
# Base Playwright methods work
await page.goto("https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand")

# Stagehand overrides Playwright objects
await page.act("click on the contributors")
```

## Stagehand v. Playwright
Below is an example of how to extract a list of companies from the AI Grant website using both Stagehand and Playwright.

The above example with Stagehand can be easily reused to extract data from other websites, whereas the Playwright example would need to be rewritten for each new website.
